**Tasks:**
**Single Event / Sessions**
The purpose of this task was to allow a user to broadcast an event publicly with relevant information such as the title, owner, description, time, and location of the event through the use of a Form.  This information was stored in the Event_Class table within the database accordingly.

**Multiple Event / Sessions**
This was only possible when the previous task was completed.  Every tasks that was added into the database had to be emitted publicly to all users connected.  This was done by querying the necessary information from the database, and emitting the pulled information on a global channel via sockets.  The information was then propagated accordingly in order to display the event information to the user.

**Basic Styling**
This was just a quick mockup in order to get a good idea of how we'll want the app to eventually look.  The main purpose of this was to dictate shape and size of components on the screen.
